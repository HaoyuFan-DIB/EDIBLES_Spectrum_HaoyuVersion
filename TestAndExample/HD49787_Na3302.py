# if you already know there are two pieces of spectra to be masked, you can use sp.addMask(n=2)
# the continuum fitting is an iteration process, so don't worry if you miss a few point for the masking
# currently there are two continuum-fitting modes: polynomial and spline. You can use "p" and "s" for short
# n is the max-order for polynomial, or the number of points for spoine
# min_sigma is related to "what points are on the continuum", by default it is set to 0.3 but the spectra is a little
# noisy in this case so I set it to 0.5



# Model building

# All lines were assumed to have Voigt profile in optical depth
# There are two types of lines eventually, those with known wavelength whose position is defined by velocity-offset
# The ohter kind of line has "flexible" wavelengths
# The more basic model is a "Cloud" containing several lines with known wavelengths, they share the same ISM velocity,
# and their b parameters, representing the Gaussian width, can be "linked"
# A more complicated model is called "Sightline", that contains several clouds at different velocities, and a list of
# lines with flexible wavelengths
# We are using a Sightline model containing the sodium doublet

# but before create the model, we can estimate the position (v-offset) and strength (tau_0) of the lines
# let's start by convert the spectra into velocity frame
sp.converToVelocity(center=sodium_wavelength[0])
sp.showSpectrum()

# we can also get the numbers using the interacting figures
sp.getPosition_visual(n=4,wavelength=sodium_wavelength,tau_0=True,panels=0)
# n is the number of points to be taken
# wavelength if set, will be used to return relative velocity rather than wavelength
# tau_0, if set, will return the estimated tau_0 (using default b and d) for the model

model_working.addLine_toclouds(sodium_wavelength,velocity=34.3, tau_0=[0.007,0.004])
# note since the two components are blending, I somewhat reduced the tau_0 from the earlier reported values
# you can also use clouds_idx, cloud_name to specific add lines to which cloud
# but use velocity (that is dfferent from existing ones in Sightline) can add a new cloud to sightline
# or you can also creat a Cloud instance and import that into sightline
# .addline_tolines will allow you to add flexible wavelength lines

# note model_working is not the model, we need to compile it, and import it to edibles-spectrum
# Since we have multiple components in this model which makes it more complex, it is better to "fix" the offset from
# convolution. This offset can be calculated as follow, and included in the parameter when building the model. It will
# be corrected again when we read the result. A undesired detour but it works :-(
